<h4>Coffee . . . I drink it like water. Instead of drinking 8 cups of water per day, it's more like 8 cups of coffee a day. OK, a bit of an exaggeration -- well, back in 2003, that was my habit.</h4>
 
<h4>When I first moved to Long Island City in 2010, there were only a couple of spots to get coffee: Dunkin' Donuts and Triple Atlas (now Clever Blend).</h4>
    
<h4>It's not Williamsburg, but a whole neighborhood of coffee shops have put down roots in the community.</h4>

    <h4>Also, I've excluded big chains like Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks. It's not that I don't go to said places, but 9 times out of 10, it's not the first place I'll hit up.</h4>
